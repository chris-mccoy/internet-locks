Description from TI:

~~~~
The CC2541 is a power-optimized true system-on-chip (SoC) solution for both Bluetooth low energy and proprietary 2.4-GHz applications. It enables robust network nodes to be built with low total bill-of-material costs. The CC2541 combines the excellent performance of a leading RF transceiver with an industry-standard enhanced 8051 MCU, in-system programmable flash memory, 8-KB RAM, and many other powerful supporting features and peripherals. The CC2541 is highly suited for systems where ultralow power consumption is required. This is specified by various operating modes. Short transition times between operating modes further enable low power consumption.

The CC2541 is pin-compatible with the CC2540 in the 6-mm × 6-mm QFN40 package, if the USB is not used on the CC2540 and the I2C/extra I/O is not used on the CC2541. Compared to the CC2540, the CC2541 provides lower RF current consumption. The CC2541 does not have the USB interface of the CC2540, and provides lower maximum output power in TX mode. The CC2541 also adds a HW I2C interface.

The CC2541 is pin-compatible with the CC2533 RF4CE-optimized IEEE 802.15.4 SoC.

The CC2541 comes in two different versions: CC2541F128/F256, with 128 KB and 256 KB of flash memory, respectively.
