It appears that the August has a DRV8833 Texas Instrument 2A Low Voltage Dual Brushed DC or Single Bipolar Stepper Motor Driver 
( http://www.ti.com/product/drv8833 )

From TI:

The DRV8833 provides a dual bridge motor driver solution for toys, printers, and other mechatronic applications.

The device has two H-bridge drivers, and can drive two DC brush motors, a bipolar stepper motor, solenoids, or other inductive loads.

The output driver block of each H-bridge consists of N-channel power MOSFETâ€™s configured as an H-bridge to drive the motor windings. Each H-bridge includes circuitry to regulate or limit the winding current.

Internal shutdown functions with a fault output pin are provided for over current protection, short circuit protection, under voltage lockout and overtemperature. A low-power sleep mode is also provided.

The DRV8833 is packaged in a 16-pin HTSSOP or QFN package with PowerPAD
